# Yelmo

This is the code repository for the ice sheet model Yelmo.
While the model has been designed to be easy to use, there
are many parameters that require knowledge of ice-sheet
physics and numerous parameterizations. The (growing) model documentation
is provide to provide help with proper use of the model. 

The model is described in the following article:
Robinson et al., in prep.
